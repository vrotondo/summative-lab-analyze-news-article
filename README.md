Summative Lab: Analyze a News Article
Imagine you're a junior software developer working at a tech startup that specializes in Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions. Your team is working on a project to analyze the content of news articles to extract valuable insights. As part of this project, you've been tasked with developing a Python program that can perform various text analysis tasks on a given news article. These tasks include counting the number of times a specific word is used, identifying the most common word, calculating the average length of words, counting the number of paragraphs, and counting the number of sentences in the text.

Tools and Resources
Python IDE, Visual Studio Code.
Use the News Article for Python AssessmentLinks to an external site. as the article to analyze.
Instructions
Define the Problem
Develop a Python script/program that can perform various text analysis tasks on a given news article.

Determine the Design
Read the contents of the provided news article text file into a Python string variable.

Count Specific Word
Implement a function that counts the number of occurrences of the specified (TBD) word in the text.
Display the count of the specified word.
Identify Most Common Word
Implement a function that identifies the most common word in the text.
Display the most common word.
Calculate Average Word Length
Implement a function that calculates the average length of words in the text.
Exclude punctuation marks and special characters from the word length calculation.
Display the average word length.
Count Number of Paragraphs
Implement a function that counts the number of paragraphs in the text.
Define paragraphs based on empty lines between blocks of text.
Display the count of paragraphs.
Count Number of Sentences
Implement a function that counts the number of sentences in the text.
Define sentences based on punctuation marks such as periods, exclamation marks, and question marks.
Display the count of sentences.
Develop Code
Develop your code and script to match the design. Your script should adhere to the following: 

Text Analysis: Correct implementation of each text analysis task
Efficiency: Efficiency and readability of the code
Functions and Variables: Proper use of functions and appropriate variable names
Accuracy: Accuracy in counting words, paragraphs, and sentences
Coding Best Practices: Adherence to Python coding conventions and best practices
Clarity: Clarity and completeness of user prompts and output
Test and Refine 
Run your program with different number of occurrences and parameters.
Verify that the appropriate code blocks are executed based on the conditions. 
Make any necessary adjustments to the code blocks to achieve the desired outcome.
Document and Maintain
Version Control: Use version control to track changes. This allows for easy updates, collaborative editing, and the ability to revert to previous versions if necessary.
Regular Updates and Reviews: Schedule regular reviews and updates for code to ensure content remains relevant, accurate, and aligned with the latest Python developments and industry practices.
Documentation and Examples Repository: Maintain a centralized repository containing all lab documents, example code, and solutions.
